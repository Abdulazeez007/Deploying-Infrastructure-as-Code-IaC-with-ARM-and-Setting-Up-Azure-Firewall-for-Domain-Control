# Deploying-Infrastructure-as-Code-IaC-with-ARM-and-Setting-Up-Azure-Firewall-for-Domain-Control
This project focuses on setting up Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates to automate and streamline the deployment of Azure resources. Additionally, I'll configures Azure Firewall to manage and control outbound traffic to specific domains, enhancing security and ensuring compliance with organizational policies. This approach provides scalable, consistent deployments and precise traffic filtering to designated destinations.

**KEY OBJECTIVES**  

1. üõ†Ô∏è Use ARM Template to deploy the Lab Environment  
2. üî• Deploy and Configure Azure Firewall  
3. üö¶ Create Firewall Route and Associate with Subnet  
4. üìú Configure Firewall Application and Network Rules  
5. üåê Configure DNS Servers  
6. ‚úÖ Test the Firewall

## STEP 1:  Use ARM Template to Deploy Lab Environment.
- First, I launched my Azure portal, then in the Azure portal, search Deploy a custom template and press the Enter key.
- On the Custom deployment blade, click the Build your own template in the editor option.
- click on load file, and select the ARM template which is a .json file.
- Upload ARM template (Download template fromAzure AZ500 Github Lab ***https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ500-AzureSecurityTechnologies/blob/master/Allfiles/Labs/08/template.json***)

- Edit Template
- Review and Create

![SOC](Deployment successful)


## STEP 2: Configure and Deploy Azure Firewall
- In the Azure Portal, Search Firewall, In the Firewall blade, click Create.

**Configure Firewall settings:**
- Deploy Firewall to specific VNET that was deployed with the ARM Template, and configure public IP and other neccesary settings.

## STEP 3: Create a default route for our workload subnet, (this route will configure outbound traffic throught the firewall.)
- In the Azure Portal, Search Route Tables, and create a new route.
- configure and create new route Table.
- click create, and wait for the provisioning to complete.

**NEXT** Associate the Firewall Route to a Subnet ***Workload-SN***  
- On the Route tables blade, click Refresh, and, in the list of route tables, click the Firewall-route entry.
- On the Firewall-route blade, in the Settings section, click Subnets and then, on the Firewall-route | Subnets blade, click + Associate.
- On the Associate subnet blade, specify the following settings:
- Click OK to associate the firewall to the virtual network subnet.
