# Deploying-Infrastructure-as-Code-IaC-with-ARM-and-Setting-Up-Azure-Firewall-for-Domain-Control
This project focuses on setting up Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates to automate and streamline the deployment of Azure resources. Additionally, I'll configures Azure Firewall to manage and control outbound traffic to specific domains, enhancing security and ensuring compliance with organizational policies. This approach provides scalable, consistent deployments and precise traffic filtering to designated destinations.

## STEP 1:  Use ARM Template to Deploy Lab Environment.
- First, I launched my Azure portal, then in the Azure portal, search Deploy a custom template and press the Enter key.
- On the Custom deployment blade, click the Build your own template in the editor option.
- click on load file, and select the ARM template which is a .json file.
- Upload ARM template (Download template fromAzure AZ500 Github Lab ***https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ500-AzureSecurityTechnologies/blob/master/Allfiles/Labs/08/template.json***)

![SOC](https://github.com/Virus192/Deploying-Infrastructure-as-Code-IaC-with-ARM-and-Setting-Up-Azure-Firewall-for-Domain-Control/blob/main/ARM-Firewall/Template.jpg)

- Edit Template
- Review and Create

## STEP 2: Configure and Deploy Azure Firewall
- In the Azure Portal, Search Firewall, In the Firewall blade, click Create.

**Configure Firewall settings:**
- Deploy Firewall to specific VNET that was deployed with the ARM Template, and configure public IP and other neccesary settings.

## STEP 3: Create a default route for our workload subnet, (this route will configure outbound traffic throught the firewall.)
- In the Azure Portal, Search Route Tables, and create a new route.
- configure and create new route Table.
- click create, and wait for the provisioning to complete.

![SOC](https://github.com/Virus192/Deploying-Infrastructure-as-Code-IaC-with-ARM-and-Setting-Up-Azure-Firewall-for-Domain-Control/blob/main/ARM-Firewall/Route%20Table.jpg)


**NEXT** Associate the Firewall Route to a Subnet ***Workload-SN***  
- On the Route tables blade, click Refresh, and, in the list of route tables, click the Firewall-route entry.
- On the Firewall-route blade, in the Settings section, click Subnets and then, on the Firewall-route | Subnets blade, click + Associate.
- On the Associate subnet blade, specify the following settings:
- Click OK to associate the firewall to the virtual network subnet.

![SOC]( https://github.com/Virus192/Deploying-Infrastructure-as-Code-IaC-with-ARM-and-Setting-Up-Azure-Firewall-for-Domain-Control/blob/main/ARM-Firewall/FW-Route-Subnet.jpg)

**NEXT** Associate The Firewall Route to a Route
- Back on the Firewall-route blade,
- In the Settings section, click Routes and then click + Add.
- On the Add route blade, specify the following settings: ***This route, automatically lists the Firewall‚Äôs private IP Address as the next hop address when sending out traffic out of the subnet.***
- This way, all traffic gets routed through the Azure Firewall first.
-  Click Add to add the route.

![SOC](https://github.com/Virus192/Deploying-Infrastructure-as-Code-IaC-with-ARM-and-Setting-Up-Azure-Firewall-for-Domain-Control/blob/main/routes.jpg)

## STEP 4: Configure the Application and Network rule on the Azure Firewall to specifically allow certain applications and send request to specific DNS Servers.

**I'll be creating an application rule that allows outbound access to www.bing.com.**
- Now back to the Test-FW01 firewall, On the Test-FW01 blade, in the Settings section, click Rules (classic).
- click the Application rule collection tab, and then click + Add application rule collection.
- In the Application rule, I set the target FQDN to bing.com, ***since it‚Äôs the only domain we want every machine on our Subnet to be able to connect to, with source IP being the Subnet IP address range.***
- Click Add to add the Target FQDNs-based application rule.

![SOC](App Rule for Bing)

### Next: Create and Configure a Network Rule
- Set the network rule that allows traffic routed through specific know DNS servers, to DNS port 53.
- This allows network traffic between these DNS servers, and the Subnet. ***10.0.2.0/24***

## STEP 5: Configure the virtual machine DNS servers
- Configure the custom primary and secondary DNS servers on our Work-VM NIC, to use the specific DNS servers we configured.
- On the Srv-Work blade, in the Settings section, click Networking.
- On the Srv-Work ***Virtual Machine*** | Networking blade, click the link next to the Network interface entry.

![SOC](Srv-workNetwork Setting)
- On the network interface blade, in the Settings section, click DNS servers, select the Custom option.
- Then next, add the two DNS Servers ***209.244.0.3 and 209.244.0.4***, so all outbound HTTP/s requests will be routed to these DNS servers.
- click save and wait for changes to be Deployed

## STEP 6: Test The firewall rules
- The Firewall rules by using RDP to login to the jump_server,
- Then connect to the work_server using RDP again, from my jump_server.
- Test the firewall by attempting to visit certain domains.

**First,** Connect and download the RDP File from the jump server.
- Open the RDP file and enter the login credentials that you created during the Infrastructure as Code provisioning process.

![SOC]()
 
- After successful login to the ***srv-jump server***
- Right-click on the Start menu, select "Run" from the context menu, and in the Run dialog box, enter the following command to connect to Srv-Work:

      ***mstsc /v:Srv-Work***
- Login using the same credential with the ***Srv-jump***
  
![SOC]()

- After Login into the ***Srv-Work Server*** from within the ***Srv-Jump Server***
- Now we can lauch Internet explorer and browse to www.bing.com
- Which is successful as expected due to the application firewall rules we had early configured
  
![SOC]()

### Now, let me try another domain, like Facebook.com.
- And as expected, this action was denied, because the only application allowed to return traffic to the subnet was Google.com.

![SOC]()
***Action Failed***

**Now,** I have successfully verified that my firewall is configured correctly and is functioning as intended. This confirmation ensures that the firewall is effectively managing network traffic, enforcing security policies, and protecting the network from unauthorized access. The successful implementation of the firewall contributes to the overall security posture of the environment, allowing for controlled and monitored access to resources.


## Conclusion

Successfully deploying and configuring Azure Firewall using ARM Templates showcases the power of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in establishing robust, scalable security in the cloud. This project not only strengthens network control by restricting domain access but also highlights the efficiency of automated deployments in secure, dynamic environments. Embracing IaC and advanced firewall configurations elevates any cloud security posture, making it adaptable and resilient.

## Project Highlights & Key Takeaways

### Throughout this project, I:

üåê Deployed a Cloud Environment: Leveraged Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates to provision a cloud environment using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.

üî• Configured Azure Firewall for VNET: Implemented and configured Azure Firewall within a Virtual Network (VNET) to enforce traffic control.

üéØ Set DNS-based Traffic Filtering: Directed firewall traffic to specific DNS servers, allowing only traffic from designated domain names, enhancing network security.

üîê Established Secure Server Access: Configured Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to securely jump between two servers, reinforcing access control and operational security.

Thank you for following along with this project!

üí° Final Reminder
Remember: always delete and deprovision any cloud resources when they‚Äôre no longer in use to optimize costs and maintain a secure environment.

## Clean up resources
- Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not incur unexpected costs.
- In the Azure portal, open the Cloud Shell by clicking the first icon in the top right of the Azure Portal. If prompted, click PowerShell and Create storage.
- Ensure PowerShell is selected in the drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of the Cloud Shell pane.
- In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to remove the resource group you created in this lab:

      ***Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "AZ500LAB08" -Force ***
- Close the Cloud Shell pane.
